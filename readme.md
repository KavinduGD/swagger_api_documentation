# OpenAPI Specification & Swagger Tools - Zero To Master

This repository contains my notes and learning progress from the [OpenAPI Specification & Swagger Tools - Zero To Master](https://www.udemy.com/course/openapi-specification-swagger-tools-zero-to-master/) course on Udemy.

## What I Learned

Through this course, I have gained a comprehensive understanding of the OpenAPI Specification (formerly Swagger) and its ecosystem. Key takeaways include:

-   **Fundamentals**: Understanding what APIs are, the difference between URL and URI, and the role of OpenAPI in describing HTTP APIs.
-   **Approaches**: Differentiating between "Code First" and "Design First" approaches to API development.
-   **Structure**: Mastering the structure of an OpenAPI document, including Info, Servers, Paths, Components, and Security objects.
-   **Documentation**: Learning how to write clear and effective documentation using Markdown, examples, and tags.
-   **Reusability**: Utilizing `components` to create reusable schemas, parameters, and responses to keep the spec DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
-   **Data Modeling**: Defining complex data types, handling inheritance (`allOf`) and polymorphism (`oneOf`, `anyOf`).
-   **Advanced Features**: Exploring advanced topics like Operation IDs, deprecation, links, and callbacks.
-   **Security**: Implementing various security schemes such as Basic Auth, API Keys, and OAuth 2.0.
-   **Tooling**: Leveraging tools like Swagger Editor to design specs, Swagger UI to visualize them, and Swagger Codegen/OpenAPI Generator to scaffold client and server code.
