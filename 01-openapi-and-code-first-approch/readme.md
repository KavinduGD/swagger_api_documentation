# OpenApi in code first approach

- If you have already developed or apis are available in your codebase, you can use the code first approach to generate OpenAPI specifications from your existing code.
- To that we can use **SwaggerHub** and **Swagger Explore`** tools.

- Fist send request from swagger explore and use the history to generate the OpenAPI specification in swagger hub.
